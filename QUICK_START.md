## Your Mindset

This is not a "get rich quick" scheme. This is a real business that requires:
- **Hustle**: List items daily, ship fast
- **Patience**: Build over months, not days
- **Discipline**: Reinvest profits, track numbers
- **Learning**: Improve based on data

But if you're consistent, the numbers don't lie:
- 10 items/month at $20 profit each = $200/month
- 50 items/month at $20 profit each = $1,000/month
- Scale to branded products = $5,000-$10,000/month

**You can absolutely do this. Let's get rich.**
